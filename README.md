My notes on preparing for the Ham Radio exam

Now is a great time to get your Technician's license because there is a major effort to onboard new hams.

You can even get a free radio through "QRZ Jumpstart." Several vendors and YouTubers are jumping on board with this, but start here: https://www.gigaparts.com/qrzjumpstart

I owe a debt of gratitude to HamStudy.org, operated by SignalStuff.com. It's what I used to pass all three exams myself. It is also the single best place to find a time to take the actual exam (in-person or virtual)

In my case, I definitely prefered the in-person testing when I took my Technician. However I did pass both my General and Extra with online testing. The convenience of it is fantastic!
